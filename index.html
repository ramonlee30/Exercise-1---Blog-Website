                  I was born in Havana Cuba on April 4, 2017. I had a rough life with being seperated by my mother and joining a new family for 2 weeks. This family didn't want me, threw me in a rice sack and later woke up to some nasty people who did mean things to me. I was then roaming the streets for several weeks until I found this nice lady (now what I call my mother) at her house in Cuba. My family left me with my grandma for 6 months, which granny took care of me, fed me and from time to time played with me. Then after the 6 months, my mom and dad came to pick me up in Cuba and went for a long 26 hour journey to Northern Canada. The plane ride was really scary, but when we arrived, I found a loving home and great family that spoils me.

                <p class="card-description">
                  Today we got a bit of snow and my family and I went to the local lake today for a walk. For some reason the lake is hard today and I can actually walk on it. I ran around, chased a few ducks and swans, and I got to play with a few other dogs that were visiting. This picture is my family and I resting at my favorite spot at the lake. Enjoy.

                <p class="card-description">
                  Today I got to play with my cousin Homer at the Lakelse Lake. When we arrived at the lake, my family took us out on the boat, we got to explore the lake and everyone was safe because Homer and I scouted upahead to make sure nobody was in danger. When we finally got to the campspot, my owners make a small fire and we got to enjoy some hotdogs (the trick is to beg to my mom and look her in the eye). Afterwards my cousin Homer and I went swimming, and I found a log to go and play on. This week has been great and this was the perfect outting to enjoy the weekend.

                <p class="card-description">
                 Today my family and I took a long car ride to find Hai Lake. It was really scary, the road was so bumpy and I didn't know how to protect my family, but we made it okay. Once we got there, it was a 30 minute hike to get to the lake. Once we arrived, I got to swim, jump off the dock, and go explore the woods.  It was so much fun, and I have a picture with my mom to prove it. We had a great day and I wasn't so scared on the way back. That proves sometimes scary adventures can be so much fun!!
