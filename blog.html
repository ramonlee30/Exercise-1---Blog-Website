              <p>I was born in Havana Cuba on April 4, 2017. I had a rough life with being seperated by my mother and joining a new family for 2 weeks. This family didn't want me, threw me in a rice sack and later woke up to some nasty people who did mean things to me. I was then roaming the streets for several weeks until I found this nice lady (now what I call my mother) at her house in Cuba. My family left me with my grandma for 6 months, which granny took care of me, fed me and from time to time played with me. Then after the 6 months, my mom and dad came to pick me up in Cuba and went for a long 26 hour journey to Northern Canada. The plane ride was really scary, but when we arrived, I found a loving home and great family that spoils me.</p>
              <p>Nowadays my life is amazing, my owners do amazing things with me such as....</p>
              <p>
                Go on a walking tour of your city. - Soak up your city just like a tourist would but with a much better sense of direction. If you plan your route, you can make pit-stops at all of your city’s pet-friendly haunts for treats and attention. All the tourists will be so jealous.
              </p>
              <p>Spend a day swimming and exploring a beach or lake. Some dogs are more like mermaids, so let them be part of that world! But before you do, make sure the beach or lake is dog-friendly and that you bring a doggy life vest. (Not all dogs can swim!)</p>
              <p>Run or jog together.
                Nothing tires out a pup with lots of energy like a long run. Some dogs are better suited for longer distances than others, so consider your pup’s health, the temperature outside, and always bring fuel, like treats and water. If you have a real runner on your hands — as in, a dog that’s prone to running off — it’s key to get a leash specially made for running. If this becomes a regular activity for you both, see if you can consistently beat your previous time.
